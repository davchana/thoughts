# Thoughts

Inspired by my friends [Zack](http://twitter.com/zackshapiro) and [Ryan](http://twitter.com/ryandawidjan) and their [respective](https://github.com/zackshapiro/thoughts) [approaches](https://quip.com/jgBUALiGBjwp) to this concept, I decided to create a repository that outlines things I believe to be true, core values, and half-baked thoughts<sup>1</sup>. Looking back on documents like my [daily list](http://jasdev.me/daily-list), I often wonder what prompted changes in their contents. Tracking these on GitHub allows me to do so :smile:

## Table of Contents
- [Daily List](daily-list.md)
- [Core Values](core-values.md)
