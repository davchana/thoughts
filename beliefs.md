# Beliefs

An (incomplete) list of beliefs I hold. I hope and intend on these __changing__ over time. In fact, "I've changed my mind" is a phrase I'm [trying to use more often](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/716810286980808704).

## Social Media
- Choose which social media channels you use carefully, they tend to be [release valves for ambition](https://twitter.com/ryandawidjan/status/739490348553150464).
- For “knowledge workers,” a bad information diet is akin to smoking’s ill-effects, mentally.

## Relationships
- I always want to be the person in a relationship who loves the "most."
- Default to trust, even if it bites you in the end.
- Never stop “dating“ your partner.
- Always suffix “I love you” messages with the partner’s name. There's something magically intimate about (hearing&#124;seeing) someone (say&#124;type) your name.
- On a long enough timescale, the heart always heals. Use this fact as a North Star.

## Life

## The Universe
- “[Mathematically, there have to be other life forms out there](https://github.com/zackshapiro/thoughts/blame/e60af601cd10cae131606849476b997d219c1fee/things-that-i-believe.md#L28).”
- I’m agnostic. But, if there is a God, I don’t think it interacts with our universe at all.

## Self

## Career
- Optimize for working on what you care about, not for learning. The latter usually follows from the former. The latter in the absence of the former leads to burnout.
- The counterintuitive thing about burnout is that it usually happens when you’re moving slowly (for reasons out of your control).

## Creating
- The best way to reach the next level is with a coach. These “coaches” can take [many forms](https://twitter.com/jasdev/status/823265386594443264).

## Lessons
- The best plans let you change them.
- No one knows what they’re doing, [seriously](http://jasdev.me/lessons-after-college#making).

## Learning
