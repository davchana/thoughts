Prior to boarding the subway each morning, I read this list. It helps [better align my intentions with my core values](http://jamesclear.com/values-choices). Each statement is phrased in the first-person to solidify them as [identity-based habits](http://jamesclear.com/identity-votes).

# Core Values:

- I love myself and others infinitely.
- I strive to make the world better through people.
- I practice going first.
- I seek out relationships that challenge me to grow. I aim to be that person for others.
- I have a bias towards action.
- I tend towards endurance, both physically and mentally.
- I seek out 'magic' in every encounter.
