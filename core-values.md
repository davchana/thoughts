Prior to boarding the subway each morning, I read this list. It helps [better align my intentions with my core values](http://jamesclear.com/values-choices). Each statement is phrased in the first-person to solidify them as [identity-based habits](http://jamesclear.com/identity-votes).

# Core Values:

- I'm always learning, even if it's uncomfortable. This means I'm growing.
- I love myself and others infinitely.
- I strive to make the world better through people.
- I practice going first.
- I focus solely on my own lane.
- I'm seek out relationships that challenege me to grow. I aim to be that person for others.
- I have a bias towards action.
